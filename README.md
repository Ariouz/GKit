# GKit
GraalVM native builds, simplified.

## POC Project

GKit is a CLI tool that unlocks the full GraalVM potential of your project.

Instead of configuring verbose Maven or Gradle plugins,
GKit uses a single `gkit.yml` file to describe how your native image
should be built.

GKit works with Maven, Gradle, or standalone JARs.
